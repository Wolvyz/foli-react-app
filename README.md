# Föli stop monitoring

I wanted to see how React works and created this using `create-creact-app`.

Not very stylish, but it's working! 

## Functionality
- See stops on map
- Search for departure times using stop id
- Realtime information (for departure time list)

## Todo
- TYPINGS XD
- Click stop marker on map to see departure times
- Click a monitored departure time to see vehicle location
- Eye candy

### How to

- Pull the repository
- Install dependencies e.g `yarn install`
- Start the REPL dev server with e.g. `yarn start`

Using [Digitransit API](https://digitransit.fi/en/developers/) and [Föli API](http://data.foli.fi/doc/index)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
